The goal of this task is to understand how paddibh+Nj¿ƒ_è©‡ÇcWfferent modes.  Padding is used when the file to be encrypted does not have zero remainder byte size when divided by the number of bytes in a block for the encryption mode.  This means padding will need to be used to fill the remaining space for the encryption to work.

	I repeated the step from the previous task of creating a shell script to generate keys for each of the encryption modes.  AES was chosen as the cipher since it is the most popular cipher in use today.  I then made another shell script ‚ÄòTask4Enc.sh‚Äô which creates 3 text files containing 5, 10, and 16 bytes.  This script then encrypts the 3 text files using each of the encryption modes: CBC, ECB, CFB, OFB.
	Following decryption, it appears the padding for both the CBC and ECB encryption modes was a ‚Äú.‚Äù. Both CFB and OFB modes do not utilize padding. Padding is not required for CFB or OFB modes because the ciphertext is the same length as the plainte
